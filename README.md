# stock-analysis
##Background
Steve, a recent finance graduate, is helping his parents with their investments. In particular, his parents have decided to specificall invest in green energy but have done very little research. We helped Steve analyze stock data from Dago New Energy Corporation (DQ), along with data from a few other green energy stocks. The data analysis sheet that we completed for Steve worked well, but there were a few things that could be improved. 

###Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to refactor the macro that we previously built to include allow for expansions in the original dataset as need. 

##Original versus Refactored Script

##Results
The efficiency of the code was determined by measuring how long it took to analyze the data. Below are time screenshots from the original code and refactored code for the year 2017 and 2018.
